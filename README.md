This Python code converts a decimal number to its binary equivalent. The process involves repeatedly dividing the number by 2, storing the remainders (which are the binary digits), and then reversing the order of these digits to get the correct binary representation. Finally, the binary digits are combined into a string and returned. The user inputs a decimal number, and the program outputs its binary equivalent.
